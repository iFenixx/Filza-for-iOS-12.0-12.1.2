# Filza-for-iOS-12.0-12.1.2

This is pretty much Filza, the File Manager from Cydia. I modified it so that it executes voucher_swap exploit by Brandon Azad on iOS 12.0 up to 12.1.2 and escapes the Sandbox / Gets ROOT so that you can edit files with it and stuff.

- v1.3 - Added support for A12 devices.

- v1.2 - Removed Filza's DRM that caused errors of type "The main binary was modified". Now it should allow you to change settings.

- v1.1 - Fixed Cydia Impactor issue
