# Filza-for-iOS-12.0-12.1.2

GeoFilza for iOS 12.0 to 12.1.2 (A9 -> A11) by GeoSn0w (@FCE365)

This is pretty much Filza, the File Manager from Cydia. I modified it so that it executes voucher_swap exploit by Brandon Azad on iOS 12.0 up to 12.1.2 and escapes the Sandbox / Gets ROOT so that you can edit files with it and stuff.

v1.2 - Removed Filza's DRM that caused errors of type "The main binary was modified". Now it should allow you to change settings.
v1.1 - Fixed Cydia Impactor issue
USE THE IPA NOT A SIGNING SERVICE, IT CRASHES IF YOU GET IT FROM IGNITION, NO IDEA WHY

A12 DEVICES ARE NOT SUPPORTED, NEITHER ARE 4K ONES LIKE iPHONE 5S and 6

It can write to /var/ and /tmp and it can read from anywhere. Enjoy
